The concept of personal data is the basic element of the General Data Protection Regulation. It includes all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Within the framework of the GDPR, an attempt is made to protect those data particularly. But also via so-called metadata, which is not explicitly protected by the GDPR, it is possible to draw conclusions about the identity of individuals. A functionality that offers the potential to assign information from the resulting metadata is the Search Suggestion Function (SSF) of search engines.

Search Suggestion Functions (SSF) of search engines is the automatic suggestion and completion of possible search queries based on the typing sequence already entered.

This functionality, by recording the network data stream when a search query is entered with the identification of the relevant network data packages, makes it possible to measure the typing biometrics generated when the user enters the keyboard based on these packages.
